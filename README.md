## Description
My first project I want to do is something like Kawairun. 
I loved playing that game as a kid.
I won't be doing it exactly the same, but since I remember the gameplay, I'll try to add new mechanics.

## Goals
- Create a simple 2D/3D runner with parallax
- Add obstacles and player movement mechanics
『Add optional buffs later』

## Current Plan
1. **Location**
   - Parallax background
   - Procedurally generated obstacles

2. **Player**
   - Forward-only running
   - Jumping
   - Sliding under obstacles

##  Notes
I don't like working on jump mechanics because they often have many tricky parts.  
No strict deadlines — will progress step-by-step.
I hope I can do it.

## Tech Stack
- Unity
- C#
- Blender
- Photoshop
